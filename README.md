# Spotify-album-reverser
This is a project that I've started on 7/25/2020 as a part of my <a href="https://twitter.com/blkandnotmild/status/1286500836651216897?s=20">#100DaysOfProjects</a> on Twitter. <br>

By using the Search and Playlist API's from Spotify, I want to create a web app that will create a playlist of an album that will included all the tracks in the <b> reverse </b> order after recieving input from the user<br>

This project was bootstrapped with <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">Create React App</a>
